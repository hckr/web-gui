In the future I hope this would be an easy way to have a GUI-like website layout without jQuery or any other JS library (except for this... and maybe require.js).

## Usage ##

Being honest, in the current state the project isn't very production-friendly.

You should:
* clone the git repo
* add site content files to the `inc` folder
* add new array position in `content.php`, corrosponding to the added files
* add icons' actions at the bottom of the `js/main.js` file
